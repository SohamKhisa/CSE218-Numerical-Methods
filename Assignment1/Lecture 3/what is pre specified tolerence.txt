The simple answer is that that relative tolerance and
the relative error are two sides of an inequality
expression known as the convergence criterion.

Relative error is the calculated error in the solution attempt.
Relative tolerance is the maximum amount of error 
that you as the user are willing to allow in your solution.

Iterative processes within the solver sequence 
will continue to iterate on the solution attempt 
until the calculated relative error approximation 
drops below the pre-specified relative tolerance.
